Code for "Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression Differences in Twins Discordant for Disease and Binary Phenotypes"

We created the repository to contain the code for the project "Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression Differences in Twins Discordant for Disease and Binary Phenotypes".
  
This repository has scripts written in R to download, process, and analyze data (expression).

We make all our tools and analyses accessible through a R Shiny application called DiscTwinExprDB at http://apps.chiragjpgroup.org/disctwinexprdb/ .
